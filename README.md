# 🎨 Front AI Copilot for API

## **Overview**  
A modern frontend-powered, AI-assisted API collaboration tool that bridges the gap between backend API documentation and frontend integration. It offers **live API previews**, **auto-generated code snippets**, **visual debugging**, and **one-click Mock data** — making your development workflow faster, smarter, and smoother!

---

## ✨ Features

- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Built-in AI Agent for frontend use, automatically completes common API call patterns to reduce typos and speed up coding.
- **Live API Documentation Preview**: See your API docs alongside your code in real-time. No more switching back and forth!
- **One-Click Mock Data**: Instantly generate Mock data without a backend — start frontend development immediately.
- **Visual Debugging Panel**: View parameters, headers, response statuses, and call history at a glance.
- **Light/Dark Mode Themes**: Switch between day and night modes to suit your vibe and protect those eyes.
- **TypeScript & ESLint Built-in**: Best practice configurations out of the box, keeping your code clean, safe, and maintainable.
